<h3>
What artificial intelligence is about
</h3>

<p><em>Artificial intelligence</strong></em> is the getting of computers to do things that seem
to be intelligent.  The hope is that more intelligent computers can be
more helpful to us--better able to respond to our needs and wants, and
more clever about satisfying them.

<p>But "intelligence" is a vague word.  So artificial
intelligence is not a well-defined field.  One thing it often means
is advanced software engineering, sophisticated software techniques for hard
problems that can't be solved in any easy way.  Another thing it often means
is nonnumeric ways of solving problems, since people can't handle
numbers well.  Nonnumeric ways are often "common sense" ways,
not necessarily the best ones.  So artificial-intelligence programs--like
people--are usually not perfect, and even make mistakes.

<p>Artificial intelligence includes:
<blockquote>
--Getting computers to communicate with us in human languages like English,
either by printing on a computer terminal, understanding things we type
on a computer terminal, generating speech, or understanding
our speech (<em>natural language</strong></em>);

<p>--Getting computers to remember complicated interrelated facts, and draw
conclusions from them (<em>inference</strong></em>);

<p>--Getting computers to plan sequences of actions to accomplish goals
(<em>planning</strong></em>);

<p>--Getting computers to offer us advice based on complicated rules for
various situations (<em>expert systems</strong></em>);

<p>--Getting computers to look through cameras and see what's there (<em>vision</strong></em>);

<p>--Getting computers to move themselves and objects around in
the real world (<em>robotics</strong></em>).
</blockquote>
We'll emphasize inference, planning, and expert systems in this book because
they're the "hard core" of artificial intelligence; the other three subareas
are getting quite specialized, though we'll mention them too from time
to time.  All six subareas are hard; significant progress in any will require
years of research.  But we've already had enough progress to
get some useful programs.  These programs have created much interest,
and have stimulated recent growth of the field.

<p>Success is hard to measure, though.  Perhaps the key issue in artificial
intelligence is <em>reductionism</strong></em>, the degree to which a program fails to
reflect the full complexity of human beings.  Reductionism includes how
often program behavior duplicates human behavior and how much it differs
when it does differ.  Reductionism is partly a moral issue because it
requires moral judgments.  Reductionism is also a social issue because it
relates to automation.

<h3>
Understanding artificial intelligence
</h3>

<p>Artificial intelligence techniques and ideas seem to be harder to understand
than most things in computer science, and we give you fair warning.  For one
thing, there are lots of details to worry about.  Artificial intelligence
shows best on complex problems for which general principles don't help
much, though there are a few useful general principles that we'll explain in
this book.  This means many examples in this book are several pages long,
unlike most of the examples in mathematics textbooks.

<p>Complexity limits how much the programmer can understand about what is
going on in an artificial-intelligence program.  Often the programs are
like simulations: the programmer sets conditions on the behavior
of the program, but doesn't know what will happen once it starts.
This means a different style of programming than with traditional
higher-level languages like Fortran, Pascal, PL/1, and Ada | REFERENCE 1|,

where successive refinement of a specification can mean we know
what the program is doing at every level of detail.  But
artificial-intelligence techniques, even when all their details are
hard to follow, are often the only way to solve a difficult problem.

<p>Artificial intelligence is also difficult to understand by
its content, a funny mixture of the rigorous and the unrigorous.
Certain topics are just questions of style (like much of Chapters 2, 6,
and 12), while other topics have definite rights and wrongs (like much of
Chapters 3, 5, and 11).  Artificial intelligence researchers frequently argue
about style, but publish more papers about the other topics.
And when rigor is present, it's often different from
that in the other sciences and engineering: it's not numeric but
<em>logical</strong></em>, in terms of truth and implication.

<p>Clarke's Law says that all unexplained advanced technology is like magic.
So artificial intelligence may lose its magic as you come to understand it.
Don't be discouraged.  Remember, genius is 5% inspiration
and 95% perspiration according to the best figures, though estimates vary.

<p>This book is organized around the important central ideas of artificial
intelligence rather than around application areas.  We start out (Chapters 2-5)
by explaining ways of storing and using knowledge inside computers:
facts (Chapter 2), queries (Chapter 3), rules (Chapter 4), and numbers
and lists (Chapter 5).  We examine
rule-based systems in Chapters 6-8, an extremely important subclass of
artificial intelligence programs.  We examine search techniques in
Chapters 9-11, another important subclass.  We address other important topics
in Chapters 12-14: Chapter 12 on frame representations extends
Chapter 2, Chapter 13 on long queries extends
Chapter 3, and Chapter 14 on general logical reasoning extends
Chapter 4.  We conclude in Chapter 15 with a look at evaluation and debugging
of artificial intelligence programs; that chapter is recommended for
everyone, even those who haven't read all the other chapters.  To help you,
appendices A-C review material on logic, recursion, and data
structures respectively.  Appendix D summarizes the Prolog language subset
we use in this book, Appendix E summarizes the Micro-Prolog dialect,
Appendix F gives a short bibliography, and Appendix G provides answers to
some of the exercises.
