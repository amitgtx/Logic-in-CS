1. Make rules for capturing the sequence in which balls are between storage and platform.

n balls

-S1 (contains x balls) , P (contains 2 balls) , S2 (n-x-2 balls)

WL=[]
BL=[]

S1=[b,...i]
S2=[]
P=[a]

W2(p,q)
B2(p,q)
MS(p,q)  // not B2(p,q) or

//Making the relation undirected - White2Symmentric
W2S(X,Y) :- W2(X,Y) or W2(Y,X)
B2S(X,Y) :- B2(X,Y) or B2(Y,X)
M2S(X,Y) :- M2(X,Y) or M2(Y,X)

//Making New White2 and New Black2 - Capturing all the transitivity relations 
NW2(X,Y) :- W2S(X,Y) or ((W2S(X,Z) and W2S(K,Y))
NB2(X,Y) :- B2S(X,Y) or ((B2S(X,Z) and B2S(K,Y))


W(a) :- NW2(a,_) or (M(a) and NB2(b,c))
B(a) :- NB2(a,_) or (M(a) and NW2(b,c))
M(a) :- not NB2(a,_) and not NW2(a,_)

1. If W(a) , then 
	Compare a with X (X != a), on every NW2(a,X) , append X to WL
	
	WL [ ] 
2. If B(a) , then 
	Compare a with X (X != a), on every NB2(a,X) , append X to BL

//self(A,B) :- A=B
